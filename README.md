## üìñ Overview

This project implements a sophisticated machine learning pipeline designed to predict the outcomes of La Liga football matches. By analyzing historical match data and employing state-of-the-art ensemble learning techniques, the system provides probabilistic predictions for match results.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice**  
> This project is developed **exclusively for educational and research purposes**. It should **never be used for professional betting, gambling, or any commercial applications**. The predictions are probabilistic estimates based on historical data and do not guarantee future outcomes.

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Model Comparison

| Model                  | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | F1-Score |
|------------------------|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|
| Random Forest          | 68%               | 63%                 | 0.61     |
| **Gradient Boosting**  | **78%**           | **73%**             | **0.71** |
| LightGBM               | 72%               | 67%                 | 0.65     |

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

The Gradient Boosting model demonstrates the following performance on validation data:

- **Home Win Prediction:** 76% precision, 68% recall
- **Draw Prediction:** 64% precision, 71% recall
- **Away Win Prediction:** 81% precision, 77% recall

### Important Considerations

> üìå **Key Points to Remember:**
> - Models achieve ~73% accuracy at best, meaning roughly 1 in 4 predictions may be incorrect
> - Football matches contain inherent unpredictability due to numerous factors
> - Historical performance does not guarantee future results
> - Model performance may vary across different seasons and leagues
> - Predictions should be interpreted as probabilistic estimates, not certainties

## üé® Feature Engineering Deep Dive

### Form Calculation
Weighted average of recent match results with exponential decay:
- **Win:** 3 points (weight: 1.0 for most recent)
- **Draw:** 1 point (weight: 0.8 for second most recent)
- **Loss:** 0 points (weight: 0.6, 0.4, 0.2 for older matches)

### Head-to-Head Metrics
- Win rate in last 10 encounters
- Average goal difference
- Home/away performance split

### Statistical Features
- **Goals:** Rolling average of goals scored and conceded
- **Shots:** Average shots on target and total shots
- **Cards:** Disciplinary record (yellows and reds per match)
- **Possession:** Average ball possession percentage *(if available)*

### Market Indicators
- Conversion of decimal odds to implied probabilities
- Bookmaker consensus analysis
- Overround adjustment for balanced probabilities
